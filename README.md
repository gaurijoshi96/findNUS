# findNUS

This web application enables the user to enter the location on campus they want to leave from and the venue they want to alight at. The application then outputs the various buses the user can take and the fastest route. In addition, we have a 'dining' feature where users can key in their current location and we output the places they can eat nearby!

# Target Audience 
Aim to benefit NUS students who use the NUS buses and visitors to NUS who are not aware of how to navigate around. 

# Problem definition  

We identified that some people are unable to locate certain venues on campus and they are unsure of which buses to take from one venue to another. 

#Efficiency of solution

Our solution aims to target the problem well as it provides the user with the bus to take from a bus stop to another and the building where the venue is located at. However, the user might still find difficulty in navigating from the bus stop to specific areas on campus.
 
#User Stories

As a student of NUS, I know which area of the campus a certain unfamiliar venue is located at.
As a student of NUS, the process of navigating my way around school using the NUS map is eliminated and I am able to use a more efficient way of finding my way around.

#Does your proposed features make for a good Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?

We aim to create a product that fulfills the basic criteria required such as data entry and the correct output. 

#Draft of plan to achieve end product 

1. Research on the most suitable platform to create our application. 
2. Research and develop skills on how to operate the platform. If needed, learn additional languages. (e.g python)
3. Gather the information required such as the bus stops in school, the bus routes and campus venues.
4.  Categorize information in hard copy. 
5. Create the basic outline of the application interface. 
6. Plan the codes for the information. 
7. Code the information in the application. 
8. Test out the features using valid inputs and check if the output is 100% accurate.
9. if test failed, refine prototype  until accuracy is achieved. 
10. Let peers assess the application and provide feedback. 
11. Use feedback to further refine the prototype. 

#Aim for Milestone 3 

1. Complete feature 3 
2. Design and beautify the website 
3. Insert a drop down menu for easier navigation. 


#Post milestone 3 Features

Takes in the Inputs ‘current location’ and ‘destination’
 Outputs the buses that one can take 
 Outputs the bus with the smallest number of  stops
 Outputs the number of stops 

Improvements

I am a year 3 NUS student but i am still unsure of some unfamiliar locations and which bus i can take to these locations. 
I am a NUS student and i would like to know which bus is the fastest to get to a certain location. 
I am a visitor to NUS and i am unsure of the various buses and which bus i can take to get to a certain location. 



#2. Dining Navigation 
Takes in the input ‘current location’ 
Outputs the dining places in that location 

Improvements 
Output exact location of the dining places for efficiency 

User stories
As a student / visitor, i am unaware of the different dining places around campus. 

#3. Campus Area Navigation 
Takes in the input ‘Area’
Outputs the faculty closest to that location 

Improvements 
Outputs bus stop closest to the location 


User stories
As a student/visitor, i am still unaware of the different areas and where i can find them.
