# findNUS

This web application enables the user to enter the location on campus they want to leave from and the venue they want to alight at. The application then outputs the various buses the user can take and the fastest route. In addition, we have a 'dining' feature where users can key in their current location and we output the places they can eat nearby!

# Target Audience 
Aim to benefit NUS students who use the NUS buses and visitors to NUS who are not aware of how to navigate around. 

# Problem definition  

We identified that some people are unable to locate certain venues on campus and they are unsure of which buses to take from one venue to another. 

#Efficiency of solution

Our solution aims to target the problem well as it provides the user with the bus to take from a bus stop to another and the building where the venue is located at. However, the user might still find difficulty in navigating from the bus stop to specific areas on campus.
 
#User Stories

As a student of NUS, I can figure out what bus to take from the nearest bus stop and where to alight simply by entering my current location and destination.
As a student of NUS, I know which area of the campus a certain unfamiliar venue is located at.
As a student of NUS, the process of navigating my way around school using the NUS map is eliminated and I am able to use a more efficient way of finding my way around.

#Does your proposed features make for a good Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?

We aim to create a product that fulfills the basic criteria required such as data entry and the correct output. 

#Draft of plan to achieve end product 

1. Research on the most suitable platform to create our application. 
2. Research and develop skills on how to operate the platform. If needed, learn additional languages. (e.g python)
3. Gather the information required such as the bus stops in school, the bus routes and campus venues.
4.  Categorize information in hard copy. 
5. Create the basic outline of the application interface. 
6. Plan the codes for the information. 
7. Code the information in the application. 
8. Test out the features using valid inputs and check if the output is 100% accurate.
9. if test failed, refine prototype  until accuracy is achieved. 
10. Let peers assess the application and provide feedback. 
11. Use feedback to further refine the prototype. 

#Aim for Milestone 3 

1. Complete feature 3 
2. Design and beautify the website 
3. Insert a drop down menu for easier navigation.
